>> <h3> Description </h3>
-------------------------

<p> Who says data has to be boring? This repository contains fun, different and creative Big Data projects. These are projects that simulate financial operations, data archiving, population census, academic exams, and exoplanet search.
Each project features a corresponding architecture, both a data engineering architecture and a data schema architecture.
Below is the list of projects</p>
